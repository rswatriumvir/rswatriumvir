- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rohit Swain, aka @rswatriumvir on GitHub
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in technology, public policy, and pop culture
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use visualizationn, data science, and computer algorithms to explore those areas
- ðŸ“« How to reach me @roswain2002@gmail.com

Here are some of the projects I have worked on. 

1. Data Visualization

This is a Data Visualization I made on Tableau exploring the state of the Indian Film Industry, based on IMDB data I cleaned and filtered using R. 
The full interactive dashboard is available at this link.

2. Data Cleaning and Exploration

Several US states have held public ballot initiatives to expand Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Data for these referendums was released by several states in varying formats. I decided to use R to standardize these datasets and build a data package around it. Once the data was cleaned and combined, I conducted exploratory data analysis to spot possible electoral trends in these ballot inititiatives. What I found was that certain demographic factors like race and education made people more likely to support the Medicaid expansions. Using this baseline data exploration, I was able to hone my analysis to investigate the elections in a more indepth manner. The package with my full report will be published soon on my Github. However, here is a sample of my exploratory data analysis.
